# Project Overview:
# The idea is to build a multi-agent system where different agents collaborate to complete a series of tasks. The system will include agents responsible for different components like task prioritization, resource allocation, monitoring, and adjusting strategies based on progress. Crew AI can help manage the interaction and collaboration between these agents.
